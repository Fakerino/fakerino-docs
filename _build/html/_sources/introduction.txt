Introduction
============

Fakerino is a __fake data generator__ and it can potentially generates [*every kind of data*](https://github.com/niklongstone/Fakerino/wiki/Available-Fake-Data),
from simple username and password to complex financial functions.

The usage of Fakerino is mainly oriented to facilitate testing operation,
like fill forms, __database__ population, __TDD__, __BDD__, system __mocks__, and much more.

The logical approach is very easy, Fakerino provides some basic data types (also in different languages) but allows the developer to extends its own custom types.

Fakerino can also fill with fake data a [database table](https://github.com/niklongstone/Fakerino/wiki/Functionalities), a PHP [entity](https://github.com/niklongstone/Fakerino/wiki/Functionalities) object or render a custom template, it also support data generated by a [regular expression](https://github.com/niklongstone/Fakerino/wiki/Functionalities).

It shows is real power combined with a [configuration](https://github.com/niklongstone/Fakerino/wiki/Use-a-configuration-file)(optional), it could return a particular aggregation type of data, for example can generate fake data to describe a ”Person”, a "Family", a "Response output", ...everything.

Fakerino doesn't brake the process. If the developer would like to fake something not yet supported, or not configured(or will make a wrong call), simply the result will be a random string (default Fakerino type), without blocks.
